# General Overview
This document covers some of the assumptions and design criteria we used when developing the system.

1. Sourcing of materials is primarily left to the crowd.
1. Instructions given to the donors/volunteers will always emphasize the importance of keeping items cleaned and sterile.
1. We will assume that all items are given to us contaminated and need to be cleaned in some way.
1. We will use Google Forms and Sheets to help establish a chain-of-custody from donor to point of delivery.
1. People print headbands at home, sew ties at home, and acquire needed supplies when going out for groceries. Donors MUST NOT make trips out specifically for this, limit interactions with others (ideally avoid physical interactions entirely), everyone must do their part to prevent the spread of this virus as much as possible.
1. We expect all donors to follow our guidelines for keeping items as sanitized as possible before drop-off.
1. Donors write their name and date on donation, so we can start tracking for chain-of-custody.
1. At drop-off, donors submit a Google Form detailing what they dropped off and when.
1. Volunteers verify and record the donation in batches, using a Google Sheet.
1. Batches are sanitized at one or more specifically setup and cleaned places, following detailed procedures for how to sanitize and track.
1. Once boxed, donations are placed in a specifically designated and cleaned area before being transported to destination.
1. Material donations that do not match criteria are DISCARDED, material donations that are not labeled with donor name and date or are not submitted with Google Form are DISCARDED. No exceptions. All deviations from the process are DISCARDED. This helps ensure that the face shields we provide are clean, safe and as close to medical-ready as possible.
1. Hospitals will ideally wash the shields and materials after receiving them, for additional protection.
1. We have some capacity for UVC sanitization, this will be used for shields that will be sent to hospitals.
1. When we have more materials than our ability to UVC sanitize, we will clean and sanitize them as best as we can.
1. All packages will be sealed and labeled with information such as batch number, sanitization that was performed, quantity of headbands and visors, etc.
