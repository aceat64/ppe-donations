# Making Ties Out Of T-Shirts
1. Lay an Adult size t-shirt on cutting mat. Cut off and discard the hem.

2. Using the widest ruler available and a rotary cutter, set the ruler’s 8 inch marking on the cut edge(the clean cut that removed the garment’s hem).

3. Cut the 8” wide strip down to eight 1” wide strips simply by moving the ruler to the left an inch at a time.

4. Pick up each loop and stretch it as far as it will stretch.  Doing this causes the loop to roll up on itself. It can then be cut to whatever length is needed.

Notice that t-shirts with a big printed image won’t roll up. You can simply discard those parts of the loop that won’t roll.
