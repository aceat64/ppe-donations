## Collection and Processing Procedure
### Processing Site Setup
* The site is thoroughly cleaned before each batch.
* After the site is cleaned, all gloves that were worn are discarded and everyone washes their hands again.
* The processing site consists of a "clean" and "dirty" area.
* The dirty area is where materials are placed prior to and during intake.
* The clean area is for all steps after the intake wash and rise.
* Anyone who has been in the dirty area MUST NOT enter the clean area until they have discarded their gloves, washed their hands and put on a clean pair of gloves.
