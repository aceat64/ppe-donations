# Donation Instructions
The Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) has placed a great strain on the supply chains for various kinds of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) desperately needed by those working the front lines in the fight against the disease. Due to the widespread availability and private ownership of 3d printers and sewing machines, we have a way to fill some of the gaps in PPE availability. But just building PPE isn’t enough, we need to do our best to ensure what we build is safe, reliable and easy to use. The primary goal of our work is to build face shields, based off a design approved for use by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - National Institutes of Health (NIH). The procedures we’ve built allow us to do our best to establish a “chain of custody” that will help ensure the PPE we provide has not been compromised.  

**Please read these instructions carefully, and follow them as well as you are able. It is vitally important.**

Before starting, please read and agree to the following:

1. I will not participate if myself or anyone in the household is sick or shows signs of Coronavirus.
2. I will do my best to ensure the materials I produce are safe and clean.
3. I will follow the guidelines for as best as I can.
4. I will do my part in limiting the spread of Coronavirus by going out only when required and by maintaining social distancing.

## Updates
Please check back at this page frequently, as we may make changes to process, best practices and donation drop-off locations.

## What We Need
There are 3 primary categories of items we need. Headbands printed on 3d printers, sewn ties to hold the headband on the user’s head and certain types of plastic sheets that can be used as improvised visors for the NIH approved face shield design. While many people have used this design with elastic straps or rubber bands, the input we’ve received from end-users is that ties are superior, as it allows them to pick the tightness they prefer, which increases comfort and allows them to wear the face shields for longer.


### 3D Printed Headbands
1. Download and print the headband STL file, link below. You may use ABS, PLA, PETG, ASA and Nylon.
  * [NIH - DtM-v3.0 Face Shield PPE, 3D printable headband
](https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013359)
  * [Archive.Org Backup](https://web.archive.org/save/https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013359)
  * The STL file itself is also available in this repo, but please use the NIH website as there may be critical updates to the design.
2. Thankfully the temperatures involved in 3d printing are high enough to mostly ensure the print will leave the printer clean. It is up to you to ensure it stays that way.
3. When the print completes, do not touch it until you have cleaned your hands. If possible wear new/unused gloves as well. Follow [CDC guidelines on handwashing](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html).
4. Most prints will come with rough or sharp edges on the parts of the headband that touch the user’s forehead. These edges need to be cleaned up before the part is donated. Ensure that any tools you use to clean the part have been sanitized with alcohol wipes or other cleaning solutions that are confirmed effective against Coronavirus.
5. Once the part is clean and ready to be donated, place it in a clean and sealed plastic bag (e.g. a ziplock bag).
6. Write your name and the date the part was sealed on the outside of the bag.
7. Do not open the bag again.
8. Follow the Donation Drop-Off Instructions at the end of this document, to donate the headband at one of our donation drop-off points.


### Sewn Ties
Specifically we are looking for ties that are ⅜” wide and about 24” long. There are many ways to accomplish this and whatever works best for you is acceptable, as long as the cleaning procedures are followed.

#### Making A Sewn Tie With Basic Sewing Tools
1. Finger press 1 ½” strip of fabric in half.
2. Fold each side in to meet in the middle.
3. Fold in half again, so that the two folds meet, it should be about ⅜” wide at this point.
4. Stitch down the edge as closely as possible.
5. Cut to 20"-24" (it doesn't need to be precise), optionally sew ends to keep them from unraveling.

#### Cleaning Sewn Ties
1. Wash the completed ties using soap and a small amount of bleach.
2. From this point forward, do not touch the ties except with freshly washed hands. If possible wear new/unused gloves as well. Follow [CDC guidelines on handwashing](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html).
3. Using freshly washed hands, move the washed ties to your dryer.
4. Once dried, again use freshly washed hands (additionally you can use clean/unused gloves) and place the ties in a clean and sealed plastic bag (e.g. a ziplock bag).
5. Write your name, the number of ties and the date on the outside of the bag.
6. Do not open the bag again.
7. Follow the Donation Drop-Off Instructions at the end of this document, to donate the headband at one of our donation drop-off points.

### Commercially Available Improvised Plastic Visors
The clear “visors” we are improvising for this design can come from a number of sources. The best are clear binder dividers with pre-punched holes. We prefer that the visors be delivered still in their commercial packaging, unopened. This helps ensure they are clean.
Example Visor Options
* Avery Clear Easy View Durable Plastic Dividers Item 16741
* Office Depot "clear gloss poly binding cover" Item 459-207 
* Fellowes 52311 Crystals Presentation Covers with Round Corners, 8mil 11 1/4 x 8 3/4, Clear (Pack of 100)

#### Donating Improvised Plastic Visors
1. Do not open the commercial packaging.
2. Do your best to handle the packaging so that it remains clean. Wash hands before touching it, wipe it down with a cleaning solution, etc.
3. Write your name and the date of donation on the packaging.
4. Follow the Donation Drop-Off Instructions at the end of this document, to donate the visors at one of our donation drop-off points.

## Donation Drop-Off Instructions
**Please be sure you followed the instructions above for the items you have produced/procured. Donations that do not match our criteria or do not follow the rules will be discarded for safety.**

## Where Are These Going
The first few rounds will be going to Scottish Rite hospitals. If you represent a DFW area medical facility, first responder group (FD/PD/etc) or another group on the front lines that needs face shields, please reach out and let us know what you need.

## Use Our System
Do you want to use these instructions and files to setup a similar system? GOOD! Do it! **You don't need to ask, everything here is free to use without restriction.** Just promise that you'll do your best to help out, even if that means realizing the best way to help is by simply staying home and keeping the virus from spreading.

## Other Donations
We are not accepting any other kinds donations. If you have commercial PPE or anything that could be useful, please donate it directly to an organization that can use it.

There are number of awesome groups out there coordinating manufacture and distribution of sewn face masks. If you're building these kinds of masks please check them out! One example is the Facebook group [SewStrongDallas](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3685675388169253/).
